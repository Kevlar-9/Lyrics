    <h3>Lyrics</h3>

    <pre>
        Go-go-go-go-go-gods
        Go-go-go-go-go-gods
        Ay, this is what you came for, blood on the game ball
        Everybody dropping like rainfall
        Uh, this is your moment, eyes on the pulpit, kid
        Think church just opened
        And they're singing your praises, la-la-la
        Screaming your name out lo-lo-loud
        One more step, you're immortal now, 'cause
        Once you play God, once you play God
        They're gonna crumble one by one
        Then we gon' ride right into the sun
        Like it's the day my kingdom come
        Baby, we're go-go-go-go-go-gods
        Yeah, we're go-go-go-go-go-gods
        Ay, welcome to the big show, next on the ladder
        Is it your name in the rafters?
        Brief-brief-brief moment of silence
        Bad girl woke up and chose violence
        And they're singing my praises, la-la-la
        Screaming my name out lo-lo-loud
        This is why we're immortal now, 'cause
        Once you play God, once you play God
        They're gonna crumble one by one (crumble one by one)
        Then we gon' ride right into the sun
        Like it's the day my kingdom come
        Baby, we're go-go-go-go-go-gods
        Yeah, we're go-go-go-go-go-gods
        I'm on my knees, pray for glory
        Anyone read this underdog story?
        I can't lose myself again
        Help me raise this heart
        Heart unbreakable
        Once you play God, once you play God
        They're gonna crumble one by one
        Then we gon' ride right into the sun
        Like it's the day my kingdom come
        Once you play God, once you play God
        They're gonna crumble one by one
        Then we gon' ride right into the sun
        Like it's the day my kingdom come
        Baby, we're go-go-go-go-go-gods
        Yeah, we're go-go-go-go-go-gods
        Go-go-go-go-go-gods
        Yeah, we're go-go-go-go-go-gods
        Once you play
